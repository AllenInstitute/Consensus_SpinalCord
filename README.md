# Spinal Cord Cell Type Atlas: Annotation Coordination Hub

This repository is a central resource for annotators collaborating on a cross-species consensus atlas of spinal cord cell types. Our collaborative goal is to integrate molecular, anatomical, and developmental insights to refine spinal cord cell type taxonomies in human, macaque, and mouse. 

### Goals of the Annotation Effort:
- **Establish** a consensus cell type nomenclature across species.
- **Identify** robust marker genes (including transcription factors and neurotransmitters) and assess conservation across species.
- **Clarify** neuronal diversity through anatomical and developmental characterization.
- **Reorganize** and refine clusters into biologically meaningful hierarchical groups.

### How to Participate:
- [**Create a profile**](https://celltype.info/docs/creating-a-profile) for the Cell Annotation Platform (CAP).
- [**Load the draft CAP atlas**](https://celltype.info/project/609) and click on "Molecular Data".
- [**Provide feedback**](https://celltype.info/docs/providing-feedback-on-annotations) on annotations in the [**Molecular Data Overview**](https://celltype.info/docs/molecular-data-page-overview).
- **Deadline April 16** when a virtual meeting will be held to discuss annotation progress.

### Additional Resources:
- **[CAP Orientation Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKRocgU6P8sIXJKtoyhBtOm38sMH1Z7gq)** led by Evan Biederstedt.
- **[Cell type metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pj1tI77L_GdCqj-liaCUFvvwlEDBkyj-QMRhVe9jFf0/edit?usp=sharing)** including marker genes and anatomical distributions.

## Cell Annotation Platform (CAP)

To facilitate collaborative annotation with members of the spinal cord community we are using the Cell Annotation Platform ([CAP](https://celltype.info/)) to put our work into the hands of spinal cord researchers who can provide feedback, thoughts and expert information about the consensus nomeclature system being proposed. 

We have provided the Consensus Cross-species Taxonomy as an integrated object containing nuclei/cells from Human, Macaque and Mouse as a complete Atlas and various sub-groupings of taxonomic terms to provide a higher-resolution view for each Class of cell types.

## Conserved Marker Analysis

Computational identificaiton of conserved marker genes across Macaque and Mouse is described (and stored) in this GitHub under [conserved_marker_analysis]( https://github.com/AllenInstitute/Consensus_SpinalCord/tree/main/conserved_marker_analysis).
