## Consensus Cross-species Spinal Cord Atlas

To create a consensus atlas and nomenclature of spinal cord across species, we have performed 10X Multiome and RNA-seq across the entire Macaque and Mouse cord as well as Human cervical and lumbar segments.

To facilitate collaborative annotation with members of the spinal cord community we are using the Cell Annotation Platform ([CAP](https://celltype.info/)) to put our work into the hands of spinal cord researchers to provide feedback, thoughts and expert information about the consensus nomeclature system being proposed. 

We have provided the Consensus Cross-species Taxonomy as an integrated object containing nuclei/cells from Human, Macaque and Mouse as a complete Atlas and various sub-groupings of taxonomic terms to provide a higher-resolution view for each Class of cell types.
